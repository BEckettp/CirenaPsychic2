        <h1>Introduction:</h1>
        <p>Around six month before the Pandemic i had a car and was ready to start being self employed.</p>
        <p>Pandemic hit two years later no car, But i still am going self employed.
        <p>Having to start again from scratch i will be working raising money for charity.</p><br>
        <p>I have done this before but i had a car.</p>
        <p>So How it works is i buy badges from a charity and get an id badge.</p>
        <p>Half this goes to charity and i get one pound a badge.</p>
        <p>The charity is PrizesForGoodCauses.com</p>
        <p>The owner is Roy Smith</p>
        <p>Without the car i can do around 18 hours per week.</p>
        <p>This does not include travel i am walking and getting the bus at the moment.</p>
        <p>I was told i would get help with travel expences but Reed in partership let me down.</p>
        <p>The first month family are helping to but stock and travel.</p>

        <p>Also i teach guitar and have people lined up.</p>
        <p>This will be when i get a car as it is at there homes.</p>
        <p>So first the charity and in 3 to 5 month the guitar tutoring as well.</p>

        <h1>Hours</h1>
        <p>17 - 30 hours a week.</p>
        <p>This will double to 30-45 once i get a car.</p>
        <p>The guitar lessons will be 2 - 5 a week again when i get the car</p>

        <h1>I have worked in sales all my life from when i was 15 doing tin collections.</h1>
        <p>This was in various stores Asda etc</p>
        <p>This started for the charlie bear appeal for newcastle general</p>
        <p>I worked in tenerife as a bar man but also sales.</p>

        <h1>So to start.</h1>
        <p>17 hrs x 4 wks</p>
        <p>68 hrs x 10 ph</p>
        <p>Total 680-00 a month to start</p>

        <h1>As i starting from scratch i am hoping universal credit can help untill i catch back up.</h1>
        <p>As i build back from pre-pandemic when i had a car etc</p>
